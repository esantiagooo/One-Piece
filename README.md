# One-Piece
## Description

One Piece is a JS application that leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I drew inspiration in building this project from my favorite manga series, One Piece. The manga has developed into one of the biggest and most popular manga/anime series in the world. The reason behind its success is the incredible storyline. The One piece JS application is a simple and friendly idea that allows the user to be introduced to some of the character's that exist in the storyline, the application also allows the client to create new character's that have not been included or have yet been introduced to the One Piece storyline. For familiarity, I built my own API complied with resources that I believed were important.
